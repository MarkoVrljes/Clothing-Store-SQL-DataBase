# Clothing-Store-SQL-DataBase

A fully functional GUI of a Clothing Store database in Python using TKinter and connecting to Oracle SQL Developer. 
The program presents a GUI which allows the user to login to their Ryerson Oracle account to 
establish a connection to Ryerson's Database and begin creating the Store Database. 

The database was normalized into BCNF form to reduce data redundancy, simplify the database, and provide lossless join type and dependancy preserving.

The app allows the user to CREATE, POPULATE, QUERY, and DROP Tables associated with the Clothing Store.
They can do these actions for the whole database or can specify which tables they want to perform the action on.
